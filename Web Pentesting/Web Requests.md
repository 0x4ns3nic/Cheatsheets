| Component | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scheme | http:// https:// | This is used to identify the protocol being accessed by the client, and ends with a colon and a double slash (://) |
| User Info | admin:password@ | This is an optional component that contains the credentials (separated by a colon :) used to authenticate to the host, and is separated from the host with an at sign (@) |
| Host | inlanefreight.com | The host signifies the resource location. This can be a hostname or an IP address |
| Port | :80 | The Port is separated from the Host by a colon (:). If no port is specified, http schemes default to port 80 and https default to port 443 |
| Path | /dashboard.php | This points to the resource being accessed, which can be a file or a folder. If there is no path specified, the server returns the default index (e.g. index.html). |
| Query String | ?login=true | The query string starts with a question mark (?), and consists of a parameter (e.g. login) and a value (e.g. true). Multiple parameters can be separated by an ampersand (&). |
| Fragments | #status | Fragments are processed by the browsers on the client-side to locate sections within the primary resource (e.g. a header or section on the page). |

**Note**: Our browsers usually first look up records in the local '/etc/hosts' file, and if the requested domain does not exist within it, then they would contact other DNS servers. We can use the '/etc/hosts' to manually add records to for DNS resolution, by adding the IP followed by the domain name.

`[!bash!]$ curl -O inlanefreight.com/index.html`

`[!bash!]$ curl -s -O inlanefreight.com/index.html`

```
[!bash!]$ curl -h
Usage: curl [options...] <url>
 -d, --data <data>   HTTP POST data
 -h, --help <category> Get help for commands
 -i, --include       Include protocol response headers in the output
 -o, --output <file> Write to file instead of stdout
 -O, --remote-name   Write output to a file named as the remote file
 -s, --silent        Silent mode
 -u, --user <user:password> Server user and password
 -A, --user-agent <name> Send User-Agent <name> to server
 -v, --verbose       Make the operation more talkative

This is not the full help, this menu is stripped into categories.
Use "--help category" to get an overview of all categories.
Use the user manual `man curl` or the "--help all" flag for all options.
```

**Skip cert check for curl**: `L3pr3ch4un@htb[/htb]$ curl -k https://inlanefreight.com`


**Request**

**Response**

## Browser DevTools

To open the browser devtools in either Chrome or Firefox, we can click [CTRL+SHIFT+I] or simply click [F12].

**Headers**


Headers can have one or multiple values, appended after the header name and separated by a colon. We can divide headers into the following categories:

- General Headers: They are contextual and are used to describe the message rather than its contents.
- Entity Headers: Used to describe the content (entity) transferred by a message.
- Request Headers: Used in an HTTP request and do not relate to the content of the message.
- Response Headers: Used in an HTTP response and do not relate to the content. 
- Security Headers: Class of response headers used to specify certain rules and policies 

**Specify user-agent**: `L3pr3ch4un@htb[/htb]$ curl https://www.inlanefreight.com -A 'Mozilla/5.0'`

**Head request(response headers)**: `L3pr3ch4un@htb[/htb]$ curl -I https://www.inlanefreight.com`

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| GET | Requests a specific resource. Additional data can be passed to the server via query strings in the URL (e.g. ?param=value). |
| POST | Sends data to the server. It can handle multiple types of input, such as text, PDFs, and other forms of binary data. This data is appended in the request body present after the headers. The POST method is commonly used when sending information (e.g. forms/logins) or uploading data to a website, such as images or documents. |
| HEAD | Requests the headers that would be returned if a GET request was made to the server. It doesn't return the request body and is usually made to check the response length before downloading resources. |
| PUT | Creates new resources on the server. Allowing this method without proper controls can lead to uploading malicious resources. |
| DELETE | Deletes an existing resource on the webserver. If not properly secured, can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) by deleting critical files on the web server. |
| OPTIONS | Returns information about the server, such as the methods accepted by it. |
| PATCH | Applies partial modifications to the resource at the specified location. |

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1xx | Provides information and does not affect the processing of the request. |
| 2xx | Returned when a request succeeds. |
| 3xx | Returned when the server redirects the client. |
| 4xx | Signifies improper requests from the client. For example, requesting a resource that doesn't exist or requesting a bad format. |
| 5xx | Returned when there is some problem with the HTTP server itself. |

**Specify Header value**:  `curl <url>:<port> -H "value"`


**POST Method benefits**:

- More data can be sent
- Lack of Logging
- Less Encoding Requirements

**Send post request with data**:`curl -X POST -d 'username=admin&password=admin'`

If we want to follow the redirection with cURL, we can use the -L flag.

**Add cookie instead of creds**: `curl -b 'PHPSESSID=c1nsa6op7vtk7kdis7bcnbadf1'`  or  `-H 'Cookie: PHPSESSID=c1nsa6op7vtk7kdis7bcnbadf1'`

## Crud API

| Operation | HTTP Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create | POST | Adds the specified data to the database table |
| Read | GET | Reads the specified entity from the database table |
| Update | PUT | Updates the data of the specified database table |
| Delete | DELETE | Removes the specified row from the database table |

To have curl output properly formatted in JSON format, we can pipe the output to the jq utility, which will format it properly.

```
Note: The HTTP PATCH method may also be used to update API entries instead of PUT. To be precise, PATCH is used to partially update an entry (only modify some of its data "e.g. only city_name"), while PUT is used to update the entire entry. We may also use the HTTP OPTIONS method to see which of the two is accepted by the server, and then use the appropriate method accordingly. In this section, we will be focusing on the PUT method, though their usage is quite similar.
```

**Put request**: `L3pr3ch4un@htb[/htb]$ curl -X PUT http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/api.php/city/london -d '{"city_name":"New_HTB_City", "country_name":"HTB"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'`
